## User Stories

This app seeks to help investors track their investments in real time, with the help of the API Alpha Vantage, which gives real time updates on share prices. (WIP not implemented yet) Users will have to create an account, and upon creation of their accounts, they can begin to input the shares that they have bought. The positions that they have taken will be stored, and can be condensed into a summary detailing their total profits and losses. The app can also double as a trading simulator for shares until the user feels confident enough to trade with real money.
